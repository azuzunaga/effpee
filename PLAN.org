* Learning Material Progression Plan

The following is for people that want to get started with the basics.

** Explicit Recursion

Exercises:
- https://github.com/mbbx6spp/effpee/blob/release/src/Effpee/Many.hs
- https://github.com/mbbx6spp/effpee/blob/release/src/Effpee/Stream.hs

** Cards

The =Effpee.Cards= module and associated test suite are located in files:
- [[./src/Effpee/Cards.hs][src/Effpee/Cards.hs]]: source code for the Cards practice exercises
- [[./test/Effpee/CardsTest.hs][test/Effpee/CardsTest.hs]]: test code that checks the =Effpee.Cards= module functionality.

To start you will want to follow the instructions in the first *two* TODOs which
require you to flesh out the data declaration for a =Suit= in the Cards domain and
implement `evalColor`.

You will know if you have gotten it right by checking all the tests succeed in the
corresponding test suite with the command:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
cabal new-run test:all -- --pattern=Effpee.Cards
#+END_SRC

After this will will want to follow the TODO prompts in the source file and then the
test file until there are no more TODOs left to complete.
