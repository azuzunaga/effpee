-- NOTES: sometime we don't need to define a new enum, sum of products or product type.
-- We might just need to alias or wrap an existing type. Aliasing a type merely gives
-- better readability in Haskell source. There is no type checking differentiating
-- between the alias target or the alias. However, we might want to make sure that
-- a numeric type is wrapped up as a `Celsius` to distinguish at typechecking from
-- `Kelvin`. There are different trade-offs and you might need one over the other
-- for different purposes, even when pointing to the same alias target. Using `type`
-- gives us type aliasing (I wish the keyword was `alias` but Haskell has made lots
-- of legacy decision like every older language, so I forgive it). We can declare
-- a `newtype` as a way to "wrap" a type target and providing strong type checking
-- guarantees without run-time overhead.

-- | Represents a "hand" that a player has available to them at any time.

-- TODO: You can comment out the alias for the newtype at the end of all the exercises
-- to see if it compiles and if not, do the exercise of fixing all the type checking
-- errors. This will help inform you of the relative strengths of each approach
-- so you can choose the appropriate technique for your subsequent applications
-- of this.
-- newtype Hand = MkHand [Card]


-- NOTES: We sometimes have a need to define recursive structures. We could represent
